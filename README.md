As you're aware, this project has been our focus throughout Software Engineering 2. With the course now concluded, the natural question arises: what's next for our project? Personally, **I** intend to continue its development, although at more measured pace. While I won't be adding features as rapidly as during the course, **I will remain** committed to enhancing and refining it over time.
Thank you for your support.
